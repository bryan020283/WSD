<h2> About Us  </h2>  
<br>
<br>

	<p>
Who are we?  We are just a group of rag tag veterans who love jets.  Especially old time
jets.  My nickname, is winger and I consider myself to be the head of this group.  Of 
course these old guys don't quite agree.  After they see what this young whipper snapper
made up for us, these kids and their laptops I swear.  They ought to be out there flying
jets that's what we tell them.
	</p> 
	<p>
Oh, of course, let me introduce the rest of my crew.  This large gentleman is hawk-eye.  
The funny thing about that is he didn't get that name from the air force.  His dad was
flying jets in the second world war and was probably a little cooky, but he actually
officially named his son hawk-eye.  And he's been my buddy since Vietnam.  Then we have
Hound Dog, and Wing Nut.  They're the crazy two in the bunch.  Don't tell them I said so
or I may never hear the end of it.  Those guys can't read past the first paragraph anyway
that's why I waited so long to introduce them.
