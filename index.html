<p> There were many jets involved during the fighting of World War 2.  Whether looking
at the Allied or Axis powers, you would find that they each had operational jets,
experimental and test jets in development.  

<p> The Messerschmitt Me 262 became the worlds first operational fighting jet which was
created by Nazi Germany.  Design work for the Messerschmitt Me 262 started <strong>before
</strong> World War 2 even began.  Think they were getting ready for <em>something?</em>
  Here is a picture for your reference. <br>

<h2> Let's see a jet from the U.S </h2>
	<p> The Locheed P-80 Shooting Star was one of the operational fighter jets used by the 
	United States.  It's a very attractive plane.  This is a bit of a deception because
	even though Locheed made the plane very fast, only 143 days after designing it, it wasn't
	ready in time for the war.  The war ended before this fine bird hit the skies </p>
